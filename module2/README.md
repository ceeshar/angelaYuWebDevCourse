<h2>
    Tables
</h2>

<p>
    Tables are used to represent information in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data. Tables can also be used for layout.
    The table in HTML is created using the "table" element, and the data is organized into rows and columns using the "tr" (table row), "td" (table data), "th" (table header) elements.
    Just like an ordinary HTML file, HTML Tables can be broken up into three main sections: the header (thead), body(tbody), and footer(tfoot).
    "thead" element contains the header row, which contains the column headers using "th" element. The "tbody" element contains the body of the table, which contains the rows of data using the "tr" element and cells using the "td" element. Finally, the "tfoot" element contains the footer row, which contains a summary of the data using the "td" element. 
    Using these tags helps to group the table content semantically and makes it easier to apply styles and scripts to specific parts of the table.
