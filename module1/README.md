<h1>Module 1 - Introduction to HTML</h1>

<p> 
    In this module, Angela introduces the language of the web, what is HTML? What can it do and what are the basic building blocks of HTML: tags, elements, the HTML boilerplate. 
    Angela follows a teach-apply method in her teachings that's why I've found it suitable to just re-create the site she's done in the course and just push it to git as is. 
    There are no comments in the HTML files but I've tried to explain everything I've learned down below. I hope its helpful. <em>Cheers.</em>

<h2>
    Introduction to HTML
</h2>

<p>
    <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>ark<strong>U</strong>p<strong>L</strong>anguage is a markup language used for creating and
    structuring content on the web. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to
    create web pages and applications that are displayed in web browsers.

<h2>
    The Anatomy of an HTML Element
</h2>

<p>
    <strong>HTML</strong> uses elements to define the structure and content of a web page. 
    Elements are created with using tags and those tags can be divided into two categories which are self-closing(empty) tags and paired tags respectively. 
    <ol>
        <li>
            Self-closing Tags:  Self closing tags are used for elements that don't require any content, such as images, line breaks, horizontal lines, etc. Instead of an accompanying closing tag with a (/), they include a forward slash (/) at the end of the opening tag to indicate that the tag is self-closing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Paired Tags: Also known as opening and closing tags, are a type of HTML tag that are used to enclose content between an opening and a closing tag. Paired tags are used for HTML elements that contain content, such as paragraphs, headings, lists and tables.

    </ol>

<h2>
    How to Structure Text in HTML
</h2>

<p>
    Most common ways to structure textual content in the HTML are:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Headings:</strong> Headings are used to introduce new sections or sub-sections of content. HTML provides six levels of headings, from h1 (most important heading) to h6 (the least important). Every HTML file can have only 1 h1 heading element meanwhile there could be more than 1 other heading elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Paragraphs:</strong> Paragraphs are used to separate blocks of text into individual units. Note that it's generally a good practice to use paragraphs to separate blocks of text, rather than relying on line breaks (br element) to create spacing between lines of text. This helps to ensure that your content is well-organized and easy to read.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Emphasis:</strong> Emphasis element can be used to emphasize a portion of text to indicate its importance. The "em" element is used for emphasis, italic text, while the <strong>"strong"</strong> is used for strong emphasis, bolder text. Usage of semantic tags such as em, and strong is considered a good practice from the SEO stand point. That means if you want your site to rank higher and reach the targeted audience you have to make use of semantic elements.
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>
HTML Lists
</h2>

<p>
    Lists are the another way of structuring text in HTML documents.
