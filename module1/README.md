<h1>Module 1 - Introduction to HTML</h1>

<p> 
    In this module, Angela introduces the language of the web, what is HTML? What can it do and what are the basic building blocks of HTML: tags, elements, the HTML boilerplate. 
    Angela follows a teach-apply method in her teachings that's why I've found it suitable to just re-create the site she's done in the course and just push it to git as is. 
    There are no comments in the HTML files but I've tried to explain everything I've learned down below. I hope its helpful. <em>Cheers.</em>
